# Cleansea App

As part of the FutureMaker summer program capstone project, my team created Cleansea - an app which classifies plastic debris using a CNN model and then stores it in a database. This app allows anyone to become a citizen scientist as all they need to do is take a picture and then that picture will be submitted to our database which can be used by researchers, clean-up iniatives, companies and more.
